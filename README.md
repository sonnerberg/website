This is the main website for dbwebb.se, live at [https://dbwebb.se](https://dbwebb.se/).



The short Docker story
--------------------------------

This is how you can run and develop this repo within a Docker environment.

Clone the website repo to get a clean install.

Prepare to run website in docker.

```
make docker
```

This creates the `cache/` directory where the website stores it cached files.

Remember to clean the Anax cache when making updates to files in the `content/` directory.

```
make clean-anax-cache
```

You can now can start the website container.

```
docker-compose up website
docker-compose up -d website
```

Point your browser to "localhost:8080" and wait a few secods for the cache to warm up.

Logfiles from Apache is written to `log/{access,error}.log`.

Review the `docker-compose.yaml` to see what is mounted into the container and which directories that are not (`vendor/`).

You can connect to the running container to inspect it, like this.

```
docker-compose exec website bash
```


If this gives error try running `composer install` in the folder `/app` inside the container after you have started the container with the command below. To enter container run `docker exec -it <container_name> bash`.

Start up the webserver using `docker-compose`.

```
docker-compose up -d website
```

Open a web browser to localhost:8080 to view the site.

Close down the docker container.

```
docker-compose down website
```


Really short Docker-story
--------------------------------

You may run the website directly using docker.

```
docker run -p 8080:80 dbwebb/website
```

That might be useful if you want to have your own local backup instance of the website.



Short story
--------------------------------

This is if the docker way does not work for you.

Works for me on Debian.

```
$ sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-dev php-pear php5-gd
```

```
$ git clone <the original or your forked repo>
$ cd <the original or your forked repo>
$ make etc-hosts
$ make virtual-host
$ make update
```

Now open your browser at `local.dbwebb.se` and browse the website.

If you need to upgrade your existing installation you can just redo it all.

```
$ make etc-hosts virtual-host update
```



For developers and maintainers
--------------------------------

This is guidelines on how to setup your own local development environment for this website.



### Apache and PHP

On Windows and Mac OS you may use XAMPP.

On Debian this will make it happen, it is Apache2 and PHP5 (with pecl and GD).

```
$ sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-dev php-pear php5-gd
```

Install Composer and YAML.



### Apache virtual host

You need a a Apache virtual host as local.dbwebb.se.

1) Clone the website to `~/git/dbwebb.se`.

```
$ git clone <the original or your forked repo>
$ cd <the original or your forked repo>
```

2) Create an entry in the `/etc/hosts` for local.dbwebb.se.

```
$ make etc-hosts
```

3) Create the virtual host, the basis can be found here.

```
$ make virtual-host-echo
$ make virtual-host       # On Debian to just do it
```

4) Make and publish to the local structure at ~/htdocs/dbwebb.se.

```
$ make update
```

5) Restart the webserver and open your browser at `local.dbwebb.se` and browse the website.



### Keep updated

Update the code base, the external packages and publish locally.

```
$ make update
```



### Develop and test locally

Make changes in your repo, publish using `make local-publish` and reload your browser.

```
# Do changes and then publish them locally.
$ make local-publish

# Clear the cache when publishing
$ make local-publish-clear
```



### Install all submodules

Some content is available in external submodules. To install them, where you have the properties to do so, do like this.

```
$ make submodule-init local-publish
```

To keep updated, including all submodules.

```
$ make update-all
```



Recreate all symbolic links using -r
--------------------------------

This might be useful on Windows when using WSL bash and storing the files in the Windows filesystem and using docker with mounted volumes. The script recreates all symbolic links using the `-r` flag.

```
# Go to the root of the repo
for f in $( find content -type l ); do
    l=$( readlink -f "$f" )
    unlink "$f"
    ln -srf "$l" "$f"
    echo "$f -> $l"
done
```



```                                                            
 .
